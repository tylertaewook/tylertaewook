### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



My name is Tyler, an incoming student at Columbia University, School of Engineering and Applied Science (Class of 2026).

My background is in arduino, robotics, and machine learning. 

I'm currently in Korea's national service conscription. Meanwhile, I plan to learn and explore new things in my free time until I return to Columbia in 2022 Fall.
